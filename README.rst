HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline

.. start-quickstart

Hespi takes images of specimen sheets from herbaria and first detects the various components of the sheet.

Hespi first takes a specimen sheet and detects the various components of it using the Sheet-Component Model. 
Then any full database label detected is cropped and this is given to the Label-Field Model 
which detects different textual fields written on the label. 
A Label Classifier is also used to determine the type of text written on the label. 
If it is printed or typewritten, then the text of each field is given to an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) engine 
and if there is handwriting, then each field is given to the Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) engine. 
Finally, the result of the fields is post-processed before being written into 
an HTML report, a CSV file and text files. 

The stages of the pipeline are explained in the `documentation for the pipeline <https://rbturnbull.github.io/hespi/pipeline.html>`_.


Installation
==================================

Install hespi using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install hespi

The first time it runs, it will download the required model weights from the internet.

It is recommended that you also install `Tesseract <https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html>`_ so that this can be used in the text recognition part of the pipeline.

To install the development version, see the `documentation for contributing <https://rbturnbull.github.io/hespi/contributing.html>`_.


Usage
==================================

To run the pipeline, use the executable ``hespi`` and give it any number of images:

.. code-block:: bash

    hespi image1.jpg image2.jpg

This will prompt you to specify an output directory. You can set the output directory with the command with the ``--output-dir`` argument:

.. code-block:: bash

    hespi images/*.tif --output-dir ./hespi-output

The detected components and text fields will be cropped and stored in the output directory. 
There will also be a CSV file with the filename ``hespi-results.csv`` in the output directory with the text recognition results for any institutional labels found.

More information on the command line arguments can be found in the `Command Line Reference <https://rbturnbull.github.io/hespi/cli.html>`_ in the documentation.

There is another command line utility called ``hespi-tools`` which provides additional functionality.
See the `documentation <https://rbturnbull.github.io/hespi/cli.html#hespi-tools>`_ for more information.
